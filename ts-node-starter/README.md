# TS Node Starter

This repository serves as a barebones template for Node.js projects using TypeScript. It provides a minimal setup with basic functionality, formatting, and linting to help you kickstart your project. It contains only a single `main.ts` file with a console log.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for better development experience.
- **Node.js**: Lightweight and efficient runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Biome.js**: Code Formatting & Linting for consistent code quality.

## Getting Started
