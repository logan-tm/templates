# TS Node Starter

This repository serves as a barebones template for Node.js projects using TypeScript. It provides a minimal setup with basic functionality, formatting, and linting to help you kickstart your project.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for better development experience.
- **Node.js**: Lightweight and efficient runtime for building server-side applications.
- **ESLint**: Linting for consistent code quality.
- **Prettier**: Code formatting for a clean and readable codebase.
- **Nodemon**: Automatic server restarts during development.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/logan-tm/ts-node-starter.git
cd ts-node-starter
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the development server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Build the project**:

npm start
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server with live reload.
